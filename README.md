3. * I'm always passionate of learning new information and developing myself as a person
   * I hope I can increase my coding skills with the help of this course and become a competent front-end developer in the future
   * My main goal is to prove myself as a specialist, enjoy my everyday life, get a satisfaction from day-to-day working process and realize that I'm in on the right place
   * My aim is to leave abroad sometime in the future, travel around the world and see the majority of foreign countries. Such aim becomes more realistic if I come to the point when my job is highly in demand and can easily provide me with all the necessary facilities. That's why I'm here and ready to explore something spectacular :)
   * My hobby is sports. The favourite ones are football, table tennis and hanball.
   * Some curious facts about me: 
      - I had been playing handball for 3 years during school years and was captaing our schools's team on the competition. Our school PE teacher was handball player himself previously and so he was the coach of our team.
      - My father is a football coach is currently the head coach of women's Belarus national mini-fotball team. Probably that's why sports can be called my passion :) 

4. * I was studying such programming languages as C++, C# and C during previous years in university. Knowledge level is basic with understanding of the OOP principles of every mentioned language. 
   * I was good at Pascal back in school but who cares about it right now :)
   * Currently studying JS and learned all the basics regarding HTML/CSS befre that.

5. I hadn't got any Front-end developing experience before starting the TMS-course. 
   So hopefully many exciting things will come soon.

6. * Currently I'm a 3-year student of BSUIR and TMS-courses
   * Was graduated from 56th Gynmasium of Minsk with a gold medal
   * I often look for some additional information on topics I find appealing in the network  

7. Last year I had been a studying on Streamline language courses for 9 months before I've got a B2-sertificate which represents my English skills as for now.
